<h1>The Best Marvel's Avengers Movies According  to Paulo (Not really just doing this for the project)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Avengers movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>Most action packed and have a good length movie.</p>

<h3>Avengers (2012)</h3>
<p>A very good start and it's better than the sequel.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Too long but still worth it.<br>
I'm not fan of time travel to past but still nostalgic.<br />
Good movie but not as good as Infinity War.</p>
